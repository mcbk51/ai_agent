Accepts a coding task (e.g., "strings aren't splitting in my app, pweeze fix 🥺👉🏽👈🏽")
Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task, for example:
Scan the files in a directory
Read a file's contents
Overwrite a file's contents
Execute the python interpreter on a file
Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails miserably, which is possible)
